# allp is to be used to execute commands parallely in all the nodes.
# hence Command 1 will be executed in all nodes parallely in all nodes
# before moving on to Command 2
allp:
  - Command 1

# alls is to be used to execute commands sequentially in all nodes
# hence Command 1 will be executed in each node sequentially before
# Command 2
alls:
